Hello, Mike!
hey nick


so nick i got a plan for this. he says he wants a seperate server and client. i think it 
would be smarter to have them be the same. the program would just start by trying 
to connect to somone listening at the socket. if it doesnt find anyone listening then 
it will connect to the socket and start listening. this way you dont need to worry 
about starting up the server before the client. much easier. also it will make the code base 
for the server and the client exactly the same.


Im also thinking that i would like to work with c. the reason being i have just been doing a bunch o
of socket programming with c and have it very fresh in my mind. we can talk about it but im 
leaning towards c right now. 


mmmm but maybe scala. im just worried about how long it will take to relearn it. java sure i coudl get back to that in 
a couple days. but scala is just alot different than what i have been programming all semester and 
i havent done it anywhere near as much
